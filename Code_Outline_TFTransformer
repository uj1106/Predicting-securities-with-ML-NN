# # Rough Outline - Temporal Fusion Transformer (TensorFlow / Keras)
# *Goal: Build a TFT model for Nifty prediction using a more "from-scratch" approach.*
# *Methodology: Use TensorFlow and Keras to build the model architecture manually.*
# *Note: This requires a much deeper understanding of deep learning layers and data windowing.*

# ## 1. Imports and Setup
# Imports are focused on TensorFlow and standard data science libraries.

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import yfinance as yf
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import TimeSeriesSplit
import optuna
import warnings

warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

# ## 2. Data Loading and Preparation
# This part remains the same as the other models.

# Load market data (Nifty)
nifty_df = yf.download('^NSEI', start='2019-01-01', end='2024-12-31')

# Load external data from local files
vix_df = pd.read_csv('vix_data.csv', parse_dates=['Date'], index_col='Date')
macro_df = pd.read_csv('macro_data.csv', parse_dates=['Date'], index_col='Date')

# Combine and clean
merged_df = nifty_df.join(vix_df['Price'].rename('India_VIX'), how='inner')
merged_df = merged_df.join(macro_df, how='inner')
df = merged_df[['Close', 'High', 'Low', 'Volume', 'India_VIX', 'Interest_Rate', 'USD_INR']]

print("Data loaded. Shape:", df.shape)


# ## 3. Feature Engineering
# The same feature creation logic applies here.

def create_advanced_features(data):
    """Create the same set of features as the other model."""
    # This function would contain the same logic as the XGBoost notebook:
    # - RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, ATR calculations
    # - GARCH Volatility Forecast
    # - Lag features are less critical here as the model learns from sequences, but can be included.
    df = data.copy()
    df['RSI'] = df['Close'].rolling(14).mean() # simplified placeholder
    return df

featured_df = create_advanced_features(df)
print("Feature engineering complete.")


# ## 4. Manual Data Windowing
# This is a critical step. We need a function to create sequences from our flat table.

def create_sequences(data, target, past_steps=60, future_steps=1):
    """
    Creates sequences of past observations (X) and future targets (y).
    """
    X, y = [], []
    for i in range(past_steps, len(data) - future_steps + 1):
        X.append(data.iloc[i - past_steps:i, 0:data.shape[1]])
        y.append(target.iloc[i + future_steps - 1:i + future_steps, 0])
    return np.array(X), np.array(y)

# TODO: Split data into training/validation/test sets BEFORE scaling.
# Then scale each set based on the training set's scaler.
# X_train, y_train = create_sequences(train_df, train_target)
# ... etc.

print("Data windowing function defined.")


# ## 5. Building the TFT Model in Keras
# This is the most complex part. We would define custom layers and then
# use the Keras Functional API to connect them into the full TFT architecture.

# TODO: Define custom layers like GatedLinearUnit, VariableSelectionNetwork, etc.
# Example custom layer:
# class GatedLinearUnit(layers.Layer):
#     # ... implementation ...

# TODO: Define the full TFT model architecture using the functional API.
# This would involve connecting inputs, GRN layers, attention layers, and outputs.
# def build_tft_model(input_shape, hidden_units, attention_heads, dropout_rate):
#     # ... complex Keras code to define the model architecture ...
#     # model = keras.Model(inputs=..., outputs=...)
#     # model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
#     # return model

print("TFT model architecture would be defined here.")


# ## 6. Model Training and Tuning with Optuna
# The Optuna objective function would now build and train our Keras model.
# Still using TimeSeriesSplit for robust validation.

# def objective_tft_tf(trial):
#     # Suggest hyperparameters for the Keras model
#     # hidden_units = trial.suggest_int(...)
#     # dropout_rate = trial.suggest_float(...)

#     # Run walk-forward validation loop...
#     # for fold ...
#     #     build_tft_model(...)
#     #     model.fit(...)
#     #     calculate error ...
#
#     # return average_error

# print("Optuna objective function for Keras model would be defined here.")


# ## 7. Final Evaluation
# Same final step: train the best model on the full training set and evaluate
# on a completely held-out test set to get a final, unbiased performance measure.

print("Outline complete. This approach requires significant custom Keras development.")
